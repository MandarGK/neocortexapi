Project Title :- To Implement The new Spatial Learning Experiment.

Project Description:- 
- In this Experiment the Output of Spatial Pooler which is SDR (Sparse Distribution Representation) is getting compared with the previous Output.
- During the Learning Time, the Spatial Pooler will create SDRs for the same input. After a while the SDR will maintain the Stable state. 
- The Stable state is derived on the basis of a value isInStableState is set to true, Since there is No change Detected in further SDRs.
- Since the Experiment runs to its Pre-Defined 1000 Cycles But the Stable state is achieved before reaching the 1000th Cycle.
- We need to set some rules of Comparing the SDR and Build a New Logic to Compare the SDRs in appropriate manner so that it should take a set of Min Cycles to Achieve the Stable State and as soon as it get into Stable state we will exit the Loop.
